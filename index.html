                ple for law enforcement to catch wanted criminals with our state of the art detection system. Your own store never has to worry about getting
                 robbed ever again, with our technology enabling crime detection in real time, and integrating everything with law enforcement to create a way to
                  instantly catch criminals. These technological innovations will help drastically reduce crimes against local stores and shops, and
                   makes it very easy and simple to instantly make your business a lot safer!.</p>

              <p id="paragraph2" >India alone has about one burglary, robbery, or break-in every three minutes. Our team, Inject, realised the urgency of the situation and set out to create a prototype to put a stop to it all. As a result, we developed our security system to significantly improve the problem of security. Most security systems are expensive and difficult to maintain, and our objective at Inject was to create a successful prototype that was not only cost effective but also efficient. If retailers implement these basic adjustments in conjunction with technological developments, society may vastly increase social security.

                 crimes. This is why we introduce Inject, designed to help identify criminals with a stunning degree of accuracy, and help stores

     <h1>Security is the future</h1>
     <p>With the world rapidly undergoing changes of technology, securities and systems are more prone to hacking and corruption. This is why we,inject have decided to show case some prototypes of secuirty systems that we can use to demonstrate a more efficent way of securities. One being the use of image recognition to capture intruders and notify owners, with the worlds poppulation growing it is important to be on a look out for potential threats. Another one being a live reciept scanner that ensures no customers leave without paying this can not only tackle the problem of shop lifting but redesign the unefficent way of keeping track of customers. Another prototype that we have decided to make is an effective emergency calling feature that if any threats are noticed it calls police </p>
